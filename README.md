# learning_ruby
Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

# Important Notes

* No arguments no brackets at the definition or calling.
* String can be single or double quotes.
* "+" operator works for string concatanation.
* var.class shows the variables from which class.
* var.methods will show what methods are applicable to the variable.
* to check if a string is null or not --> string.nil?
* irb cmd for calling interactive ruby console.
* ctrl+l for clearing irb console.
* String interpolation -- "My name is #{var}"
* String interpolation doesn't work with single quotes
* If we use single quotes then it escape the var part by showing a escape character while printing
* single quote within single quote doesn't work.One pair should be different
* If we want to escape the error then we have to use a escape sequence before the single quote -- 'My name is "\"'Rahul''
* string.length for printing length of the string
* "string".empty? to check if the string is empty or not
* "".nil? will evaluate to false because nothing in a string is treated as a string in case of nil method.
* .empty is more convenient to use.
* .to_f for converting integer to float
* we can use .0 after the integer for integer division
* int.odd? returns whether the integer is odd or not
* everythin in ruby is an object that's why we can call functions on that object
* rand(limit) to generate a random number between 0 to limit excluding limit.
