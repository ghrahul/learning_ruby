# Important Notes

* No arguments no brackets at the definition or calling.
* String can be single or double quotes.
* "+"" operator works for string concatanation.
* var.class shows the variables from which class.
* var.methods will show what methods are applicable to the variable.
* to check if a string is null or not --> string.nil?
* irb cmd for calling interactive ruby console.
* ctrl+l for clearing irb console.
* String interpolation -- "My name is #{var}"
* String interpolation doesn't work with single quotes
* If we use single quotes then it escape the var part by showing a escape character while printing
* single quote within single quote doesn't work.One pair should be different
* If we want to escape the error then we have to use a escape sequence before the single quote -- 'My name is \'Rahul''
